## [Git and GitHub Intro](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/git-intro.md)
###  [Task - Git and GitHub Intro](https://github.com/AlexPoliakov/kottans-frontend/blob/develop/task_0/task_0.md)
- A great attempt to update knowledge on Git and GitHub;
- The course "How to Use Git and GitHub" is cognitive, well-structured, but the manner of teaching is very melancholic and frankly - boring;
---------------------
## [Linux CLI, and HTTP](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/linux-cli-http.md)
### [Task - Linux CLI, and HTTP](https://github.com/AlexPoliakov/kottans-frontend/blob/master/task_linux_cli/task_linux_cli.md)
- Excellent material with elements of interactivity. Allows you to consolidate the studied material.

### Article:
>__"HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1"__
    and
>__"HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 2"__

- The article is a good addition to the previous courses. Gives the concept of work HTTP  and tools to view HTTP traffic.
 It also helps when designing my network infrastructure and providing a great experience to me end users.
- This tour has given me a good taste for the breadth of HTTP and enough pointers to further explore this protocol.
- The article discusses the use of such Web Frameworks and Libraries as ExpressJS, Ruby on Rails, jQuery Ajax but for me it will
be interesting to study "Promise" based HTTP client for the browser and node.js: [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).

## [Git Collaboration](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/git-collaboration.md)
### [Task - Git for Team Collaboration](https://github.com/AlexPoliakov/kottans-frontend/blob/master/task_git_collaboration/task_git_collaboration.md)

- Can be called continuation of the course "Version Control with Git" where you to learn to build projects collaboratively.
- In lesson 1, I did not learn anything new, but the following two gave excellent material for studying. That are "filtering collaborator's commits": __group commits by author with git shortlog__ (git shortlog, git shortlog -s -n, ), __filter commits with the --author flag__ (git log --author="******"), __filter commits using the --grep flag__ (git log --grep="bags"); "Determine how best to contribute to a project": __CONTRIBUTING.md File__, __GitHub Issues__, __Topic Branches__, __Best Practices__; "create a new remote with the __git remote add__ command"; using __squash commits__ (git rebase);
- All these tools I would like to use when working with projects.
