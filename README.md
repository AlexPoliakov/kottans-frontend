## [Git and GitHub Intro](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/git-intro.md)
###  [Task 0](https://github.com/AlexPoliakov/kottans-frontend/blob/develop/task_0/task_0.md)
- A great attempt to update knowledge on Git and GitHub;
- The course "How to Use Git and GitHub" is cognitive, well-structured, but the manner of teaching is very melancholic and frankly - boring;
