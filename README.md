## [Git and GitHub Intro](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/git-intro.md)
###  [Task - Git and GitHub Intro](https://github.com/AlexPoliakov/kottans-frontend/blob/develop/task_0/task_0.md)
- A great attempt to update knowledge on Git and GitHub;
- The course "How to Use Git and GitHub" is cognitive, well-structured, but the manner of teaching is very melancholic and frankly - boring;

## [## Linux CLI, and HTTP](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/linux-cli-http.md)
### [Task - Linux CLI, and HTTP]()
- Excellent material with elements of interactivity. Allows you to consolidate the studied material.

### Article:
>__"HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1"__
    and
>__"HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 2"__

- The article is a good addition to the previous courses. Gives the concept of work HTTP  and tools to view HTTP traffic.
 It also helps when designing my network infrastructure and providing a great experience to me end users.
- This tour has given me a good taste for the breadth of HTTP and enough pointers to further explore this protocol.
- The article discusses the use of such Web Frameworks and Libraries as ExpressJS, Ruby on Rails, jQuery Ajax but for me it will
be interesting to study "Promise" based HTTP client for the browser and node.js: [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).
